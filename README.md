## Data Transformation 
The data was already clean and ordered, so there wasn’t need for cleaning. Data was transformed using power query editor from the data ribbon in Microsoft excel.
Data was appended to form one worksheet.
A custom column was created for profit, quarter, months and year.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
The cookie store had a profit margin of 50% which is a healthy margin for most business. A good profit margin supports business growth and continuity without requiring pricing that scarces away customers.
Also, customer **Cascade Grovers** should be appreciated as they made the most orders for four (4) consecutive years. They deserve the **Most Valued Customer** award.
